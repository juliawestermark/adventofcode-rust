# Advent of code in Rust 2022

## Edit code
Note that the `<day>` parameter in the files should start with a leading zero if it's only a single letter.

Your solution code should be saved in folder `src/bin/` with name `day<day>.rs`, e.g. `day01.rs` for the first day of december. Example input should be added to folder `src/examples/` with name `example<day>.txt` and input should be added to folder `src/inputs/` with name `input<day>.txt`.

## Run script
Run
```
cargo run <day> [input|example]
```
to run the file for the specified day. The last argument is optional and specifies which input file to run. `input` is default.

## Create files
Run
```
cargo create <day>
```
to create run file from template and empty input and example files for the specified day.
